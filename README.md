# Todo It ✅
This is a todo list application web application built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice working with JavaScript modules, Webpack, and local storage.

# Features ✨
## Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks 
Users can easily create tasks by pressing the "+" button in the upper right corner of the application and entering a title, due date, subtasks (optional), a priority level, and a project. Tasks can also be edited or deleted at any time. 

## Complete Tasks
Tasks are marked complete when all subtasks are completed. Once completed, tasks will be moved to the "Completed" tab and a toast notification will appear to the right.

## Filtered Views
Users can organize their tasks by grouping them under projects, which can be added in the sidebar of the application.

## Persisted Data with localStorage
Tasks and projects are saved in the browser's local storage, so that users' data stay intact even after refreshing or closing the application.
